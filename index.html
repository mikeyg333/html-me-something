                <p class="info">Playing any kind of sport is by far my favorite kind of activity.  I love being able to compete against someone else
                 and it is a great way to stay in shape.  It's difficult to say which is my absolute favorite to play, but I've listed
                 some of the ones I've played recently.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slow-pitch softball</li>
                    <li>Ice hockey</li>
                    <li>Flag football</li>
                    <li>Ultimate frisbee</li>
                    <li>Golf</li>

                <img src="images/VideoGameHeart.jpg"/>
                <p class="info">Another fun hobby of mine is playing video games.  Some of my fondest memories growing up were sitting down in front of the TV
                with my sisters to play, whether we were taking turns trying to take down Bowser in the original Super Mario Bros at a very young
                age or competing against each other and having tons of laughs with Mario Party and Mario Kart as teenagers.  I don't play them nearly
                as much as I used to ask a kid but I still find time to get some gaming sessions in every so often.  Some of my all-time favorites
                are below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="Zelda">The Legend of Zelda series</li>
                    <li id="Last">The Last Of Us</li>
                    <li id="Mario">Super Mario 64</li>
                    <li id="Golden">Goldeneye</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="rounded">Playing guitar</h2>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-7toYWFEyk"><img src="images/HendrixGuitarFire.gif"/></a>
                <p class="info">The last hobby of mine that I'll mention here is learning how to play guitar.  Nearly everyone in my family knows how to played
                some type of musical instrument, but I never had much interest in learning as a child.  I've always loved listening to different
                kinds of music and reading about the stories behind how artists / bands got started.  In my college days, I read about one the bands
                I listened to frequently and how they taught themselves to play without being in a school band or taking lessons.  This inspired me
                go out and buy a guitar and start trying to learn.  It's been fun teaching myself but I still have a long way to go if I ever want to
                even come close as the guy in the picture above, Jimi Hendrix!</p>
